<h1>Joshua Hones</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Joshua Hones. I'm a senior at the College of Charleston studying Computer Information Systems. This will be my blog for my software engineering practicum.
  Blog entries for CSCI 462 will go here from now on. I look forward to this class and learning more about software engineering. I am also excited to work
  on the group project for the semester with my teamates Bradley Odac, Patrick McCabe, and Cormac Conahan.</p>
