				<p class="font-family-arial"><code>1.13.21 - Introduction</code><br><br>
					Hello World! Thank you for visiting my blog. I will use this space to discuss my experiences in Dr. Jim Bowring's
					sofware engineering course. This is my final semester at the College of Charleston. I am studying Computer Information Systems and hope to 
					work in either the software industry or in renewable energy in some facet. This semester I am going to complete a project with several other
					classmates working with open source software. My teamates are Bradley Odac, Patrick McCabe, and Cormac Conahan. Our group is using the name of
					"The Open Source Mafia."

				<p class="font-family-arial"><code>1.20.21 - Reflections on FOSS</code><br><br>
					In “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” Eric Raymond reflects on Linux, open source software design, and his own projects. Raymond walks us through
					his lessons for creating good open source software. The essay is an interesting read with insights into software development. It really gets 
					you thinking about the benefits of inclusivity with product design and development. People seeking out bugs to fix and features to add produce 
					better code than those doing it for work.<br><br> 

					Raymond lists 19 lessons throughout the essay all of which could have their own summary but I’m just going to touch on a few(in non particular order)<br><br>
					1) "Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch."<br><br>
					A motivated developer is a good developer. If the problem is something personal and interferes with the way a developer can use the software 
					it is much more motivating. Imagine if your favorite game, sport statistic page, or tinder didn’t work properly. People will work hard to personally
					benefit from bug fixing.<br<br><br><br>
					2) "Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite."<br><br>
					This is an example of the old expression “if it aint broke, don’t fix it.” When writing open source code you are provided 
					with a foundation to build upon. There is no need to go in and destroy someone elses product to build yours over. Take what 
					they have and use it to develop what you envision. Waste as little as possible.<br><br>
					3)"Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging."/"Given a large enough beta-tester
					and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone."<br><br>
					I grouped these ones together because its really the essence of the essay in my opinion. When people use your software they are going to explore areas
					you could never have thought of. They are going to find bugs. Lucky for you they are developers! Rapid code improvements will happen which will lead to 
					less deep structural bugs. Your code is constantly exposed and getting improved. Embrace your users and especially your beta testers!<br><br>
					
					The Bazaar approach to open source software design seems radical and chaotic but in reality the incessant updates and iterations allow it to be more 
					streamlined in development. The code is more efficient and of higher quality because the people writing it are building on the work of others. A communal 
					herd of developers proves more effective than the specialized Cathedral builder. While the team of Cathedral builders may be the most highly skilled they 
					can not do the work the herd can.<br><br>

					<p class="text-center display-4 text-wrap"><pre class="text-center font-weight-bolder">Open Source in devOps</pre></p>
					One key way to keep devOps teams fully functional during this unprecedented time is by applying open source principles. This is not a new or novel concept
					but rather something that needs to be stressed during the pandemic. Some team members may be working from home for the first time while others have done
					it plenty of times. The key is to remain a cohesive unit. There are two types of devOps teams, those that are hybrid and those that are fully remote. 
					Each type has their own unique problems and advantages. A fully remote team can be more agile because they may be working in different time zones allowing
					them to take advantage of different delivery cycles. This could also pose a problem because they may not be able to meet as easily. A hybrid team may still
					have to attend useless meetings and struggle with deciding who works from home and who does not.<br><br> 
			
				
					Some key components from the open source world that can be
					applied to devOps include focusing on community, collaboration, transparency, inclusive meritocracy, releasing early and often, and pivoting. With the current
					situation going on around the world fostering a sense of community brings a sense of normalcy to some people and allows them to forget the stress of the 
					outside world. Working remotely presents a great opportunity to be transparent, with all project information and materials being centralized. This helps
					teams to make powerful and effective decisions and understand how they affect the whole team. DevOps teams must remember to be inclusive and hear all ideas, 
					no matter who it may come from.<br><br>

					A big key to remember is that successful remote teams need to be more agile than ever. This doesn’t just apply to software delivery but how your team 
					communicates and collaborates. Teams need to be open to new ideas and willing to try new things.<br><br>

					<p class="text-center display-4 text-wrap"><pre class="text-center font-weight-bolder">DevOps vs Agile</pre></p>
					Agile and devOps are distinct, even though people think they are one in the same because of their many similarities. The two software development models are not
					adversaires, they are just different schools of thought. Agile was officially started 20 years ago, after the release of the agile manifesto. Previously, most 
					software development was some form of the waterfall model. The waterfall model was a linear track to development that worked well in manufacturing and engineering 
					but was not the most effective method for software development.<br><br>
			
					Agile invites and embraces uncertainty. Agile is build around the idea of change, and reacting to change. Focus on delivering software frequently and building 
					projects around motivated people. This 
					includes lots of face to face meetings and code review. Teams must work together and be open, honest, and transparent with each other.

				GitHubs issues is the bug tracker for sugar labs Sugarlabs, like many other current FOSS use the “issues” function of Github to track their bugs.
				Developers and users alike are free to report issues as well as feature suggestions and work on them. It seems that most bugs get attention relatively 
				quickly, especially on the more active modules. While looking through the bug reports I was able to spot a few developers who were actively reporting 
				bugs and responding to others reports. The most notable is a developer named “quozi”, but there are others who contribute consistently as well. 
				The oldest bug I was able to find was from late 2016. It seems that their was a real effort to find bugs by one developer in April 2017. In 3 days they opened
				~7 new bug reports on various
				modules.<br><br> 

				For the sake of this exercise I tried to focus on bugs that were in modules we had considered working on such as pippy, calculate, paint etc.<br><br>

				The bugs I chose include:<br>

				<p class="text-center display-4 text-wrap"><pre class="font-weight-bolder">An svg rendering different colors on different systems</pre></p>
				<br>
				
				Reported by “quozi”. The report includes different systems in which an svg renders different colors. “Quozi” later comments more systems in which the svg
				renders different.<br><
				
			
				<p class="text-center display-4 text-wrap"><pre class="font-weight-bolder">Error with bouncing objects in the pysics activiy</pre></p>
				<br>
				Bug reported by “quozi”. He walks through the steps to recreate the bug and than specifies the particular bug. No one has responded to this bug report.<br>

				
				<p class="text-center display-4 text-wrap"><pre class="font-weight-bolder">A feature request for stats at the end of memorize activity</pre></p>
				<br>
				Feature request from “sanjaymaniam”, one of the more active developers of the project. He provides a nice explanation of what he would like the game to feature 
				and why. No one has responded to this feature request.<br>

				<p class="text-center display-4 text-wrap"><pre class="font-weight-bolder">Pressing up arrow in chat</pre></p>
				<br>
				This bug was reported by “quozi” and has not been commented on by any other developers. Quozi provided a short summary of how to recreate the bug
				and the observed result vs the expected result.<br>


				<p class="text-center display-4 text-wrap"><pre class="font-weight-bolder">Sound button not working</pre></p>
				<br>
				This was reported by “ayushnawai”  he posted a quick and summarizing title of his issue. He provided the error message as well. 
				At the time of writing this has not been commented on by any other developers.<br><br>

				<p class="font-family-arial"><code>2.11.21 - What's Happening</code><br><br>
				
				
				This article was written by a collective of 6 computer scientists. This article is focused on the disconnect between modern
				computer science research and modern mobile computing. The article also poses several challenges to mobile software 
				engineers and up and coming students.<br><br> 

				Mobile apps are being created daily and some are extremely creative and complex. With the rise of Iot and edge computing it 
				is more important than ever to think about the mobile environment. By taking steps now, we can ensure the best growth for
				the mobile environment in the future.  <br><br>

				Modern apps interact with physical entities inside and outside the phone, as well as integrating  diverse services in the cloud.
				Apps have to navigate through poor connectivity, sensor inaccuracies, low battery levels and much more. This creates a huge 
				challenge as users expect apps to always be functional and operating. <br><br>

				End users want a seamless experience in their home, at work, and out and about. This “Always On” mentality is difficult for software
				engineers to deal with. We must practice defensive programming and expect that the worst will always happen when designing applications.
				<br><br>

				Cyber foraging is the concept of mobile devices offloading computing to other “surrogate” machines in the vicinity. With the amount of data 
				that modern apps are using it is increasingly important to find ways to divy up work. Instead of your smartphone using all of its 
				processing power other devices can pick up the slack. It is important that we figure out how to properly place data and computation 
				closer to mobile devices and tablets. Cloud based systems will need to push work to their surrogates and devices should automatically
				locate these proxies. <br><br>

				Android has been the focus of the majority of mobile software research. Largely because 88% of all smartphones run on it and largely 
				because it is an open source project. This makes it easy for them to customize their own solutions and research. Because Android
				has been an open source project from the beginning there are many data analysis tools available which makes conducting research 
				easier as well. However, this has made research stagnant and researchers have not dug into other cross platforms like Kotlin and 
				React Native. The majority of research has also been higher level and needs to focus more on specific problems and challenges. <br><br>

				Iot, wearables, and smartphones are going to be some of the most important areas of software development for years to come. Devices are
				going to get more and more complex and connected until computing is a seamless process between all connected devices. To achieve 
				this there needs to be a concerted effort by software developers to bring this about. Research needs to be introduced into industry. 
				Specific challenges need to be addressed and those solutions must be implemented <br><br>
